# MacOS VM Setup
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up ROS 2 on a Ubuntu 22.04 (or newer version) VM on a MacOS-based computer.

## Ubuntu VM Setup
1. Go to https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/welcome-trial/ to download the Parallels Desktop 18 for Mac. The Parallels Desktop is an application for running Windows on Mac without rebooting.
2. Open the downloaded image and double-click the install box.
3. Omit the "Get Windows 11 from Microsoft" page if you see one. Click "Skip" to navigate to "Create New" page. Under "Free Systems", click "Download Ubuntu Linux" and then click "Continue". ![Step 3](/macos_vm_setup/resources/images/pic1.jpg)

5. After the download completes, you should see a Ubuntu interface as shown below. Click the "Parallels" icon in the middle to set up a password for your Ubuntu Linux. Retype the password to confirm. ![Step 5](/macos_vm_setup/resources/images/pic2.jpg)
